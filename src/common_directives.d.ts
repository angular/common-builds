/**
 * A collection of Angular core directives that are likely to be used in each and every Angular
 * application. This includes core directives (e.g., NgIf and NgFor), and forms directives (e.g.,
 * NgModel).
 *
 * This collection can be used to quickly enumerate all the built-in directives in the `directives`
 * property of the `@Component` decorator.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * Instead of writing:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import {NgClass, NgIf, NgFor, NgSwitch, NgSwitchCase, NgSwitchDefault, NgModel, NgForm} from
 * '@angular/common';
 * import {OtherDirective} from './myDirectives';
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'myComponent.html',
 *   directives: [NgClass, NgIf, NgFor, NgSwitch, NgSwitchCase, NgSwitchDefault, NgModel, NgForm,
 * OtherDirective]
 * })
 * export class MyComponent {
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 * one could import all the common directives at once:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import {COMMON_DIRECTIVES} from '@angular/common';
 * import {OtherDirective} from './myDirectives';
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'myComponent.html',
 *   directives: [COMMON_DIRECTIVES, OtherDirective]
 * })
 * export class MyComponent {
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @experimental Contains forms which are experimental.

export declare const COMMON_DIRECTIVES: Provider[];
