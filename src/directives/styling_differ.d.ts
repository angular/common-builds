 * Used to diff and convert ngStyle/ngClass instructions into [style] and [class] bindings.
 *
 * ngStyle and ngClass both accept various forms of input and behave differently than that
 * of how [style] and [class] behave in Angular.
 *
 * The differences are:
 *  - ngStyle and ngClass both **watch** their binding values for changes each time CD runs
 *    while [style] and [class] bindings do not (they check for identity changes)
 *  - ngStyle allows for unit-based keys (e.g. `{'max-width.px':value}`) and [style] does not
 *  - ngClass supports arrays of class values and [class] only accepts map and string values
 *  - ngClass allows for multiple className keys (space-separated) within an array or map
 *     (as the * key) while [class] only accepts a simple key/value map object
 *
 * Having Angular understand and adapt to all the different forms of behavior is complicated
 * and unnecessary. Instead, ngClass and ngStyle should have their input values be converted
 * into something that the core-level [style] and [class] bindings understand.
 *
 * This [StylingDiffer] class handles this conversion by creating a new input value each time
 * the inner representation of the binding value have changed.
 *
 * ## Why do we care about ngStyle/ngClass?
 * The styling algorithm code (documented inside of `render3/interfaces/styling.ts`) needs to
 * respect and understand the styling values emitted through ngStyle and ngClass (when they
 * are present and used in a template).
 *
 * Instead of having these directives manage styling on their own, they should be included
 * into the Angular styling algorithm that exists for [style] and [class] bindings.
 *
 * Here's why:
 *
 * - If ngStyle/ngClass is used in combination with [style]/[class] bindings then the
 *   styles and classes would fall out of sync and be applied and updated at
 *   inconsistent times
 * - Both ngClass/ngStyle do not respect [class.name] and [style.prop] bindings
 *   (they will write over them given the right combination of events)
 *
 *   ```
 *   <!-- if `w1` is updated then it will always override `w2`
 *        if `w2` is updated then it will always override `w1`
 *        if both are updated at the same time then `w1` wins -->
 *   <div [ngStyle]="{width:w1}" [style.width]="w2">...</div>
 *
 *   <!-- if `w1` is updated then it will always lose to `w2`
 *        if `w2` is updated then it will always override `w1`
 *        if both are updated at the same time then `w2` wins -->
 *   <div [style]="{width:w1}" [style.width]="w2">...</div>
 *   ```
 * - ngClass/ngStyle were written as a directives and made use of maps, closures and other
 *   expensive data structures which were evaluated each time CD runs
